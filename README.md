# ConnectedNodes

Assume you have a 3x3 grid of boxes. In this grid all the boxes are white except for the boxes located at points (1,1),(2,1) ,(2,2) and (3,3). These boxes are red! 

The goal being to determine maximum number of red boxes which are connected by a side; in this case 3. The 3 boxes being (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2). 

What the python script here does is it determine the number of connected boxes not only for a 3x3 grid but for any x by y grid where x is the number of row and y columns.
